Project Objective
=================

This project provides tools to create ISO images for general use, originally developed for kitting TX120s7 and Thinkpad x220/x230 and for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 

It supports AutoInstall for Ubuntu 22.04 and later versions.

* 2024/04/26
  * Support the Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop and Server versions now.
  * Change the github repository name to ub-autoinstall-iso

References
==========

As of 22.04, the EFI boot image (boot/grub/efi.img) is no longer included in the ISO image.

Please refer to the following document for more details and a workaround if you are interested the way of creating original ISO image files.

* https://askubuntu.com/questions/1403546/ubuntu-22-04-build-iso-both-mbr-and-efi

Instructions for use
====================

Install the required packages.

    $ sudo apt update
    $ sudo apt install git make sudo

Checkout the target tag which you would like to install.

    $ git checkout refs/tags/24.04.3 -b my_24.04.3

To download the ISO image and populate the initial files, the following tasks are performed only once.

    $ make download
    $ make init

The following tasks must be performed each time an ISO file is generated;

    $ make setup
    $ make geniso

The geniso task might be failed due to the locale, so it is safe to specify LANG=C.

If you want to specify a LANG other than "C", change the GENISO_LANG value in the Makefile.

config/user-data file
---------------------

Customization of the installation process focuses on config/user-data.

* config/user-data.efi - Configuration to create ESP area for UEFI boot
* config/user-data.mbr - Configuration for MBR (BIOS) boot (if the system never boot with the user-data-.efi.)

Please place the preferred configuration file as the config/user-data.

The config/user-data.efi file is linked as config/user-data as the default setting.

If your system doesn't support the EFI boot, please use the config/user-data.mbr, instead.

The following is a summary of the major setting parameters.

config/boot/grub/grub.cfg file
------------------------------

If you would like to use any headless server which doesn't have video output, but has a serial console, please enable the following line of config/boot/grub/grub.cfg file.

    linux	/casper/vmlinuz autoinstall "ds=nocloud-net;s=file:///cdrom/" quiet  --- console=ttyS0,115200n8

Delete the existing line or comment-out the existing line as follows.

    ## linux	/casper/vmlinuz autoinstall "ds=nocloud-net;s=file:///cdrom/" quiet ---

The tested system, such as x230, can work well even the "console=ttyS0,115200n8" setting was specified.
However, other systems, such as x270, couldn't work well, so please take care of the setting.

Default user password
---------------------

Change the username: and password: lines in user-data as desired.

* ID: ubuntu
* Password: secret

The hash value specified in the password: line was generated by the following command.

    $ openssl passwd -6 -salt "$(openssl rand -hex 8)" secret

Other settings
==============

The sudoers file is arranged for use with Ansible
-------------------------------------------------

This includes a sudoers file that has been set so that no password is required for the user “ubuntu”.

If you want to change this, please edit the contents of ``config/extras/ubuntu.sudoers``.

SSH keys
--------

Following is an example for providing ssh keys to the default user, ubuntu.

    ssh:
      authorized-keys:
        - "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAAIH8mvfUPhRddvGXBxGcvwo5m3CRVOf8RbFXwaUa9mhLX comment"
        - "..."

Support for APU/APU2 or other old machines
------------------------------------------

APU and some old IA servers, such as RX100 S7, should use the isolinux.

The following configurations are made to work with devices that only have a serial terminal.

* Add ``console=ttyS0,115200n8`` to the end of the "append" line in config/isolinux/txt.cfg
* Add ``console=ttyS0,115200n8`` to the end of the "linux" line in config/boot/grub/grub.cfg.
* Add some isolinux related tasks to Makefile

To create an ISO image for installation on the APU/APU2 from a USB stick, please conduct added tasks as follows,

Perform the following procedures only the first time.
If you perform repeatedly, there is no side-effects.

    $ make download
    $ make init
    $ make setup-isolinux
    $ ln -fs user-data.mbr config/user-data
    $ sed -i -e 's/---$/--- console=ttyS0,115200n8/' config/boot/grub/grub.cfg

Repeat the following steps after editing the user-data file to generate an ISO image.

    $ make setup
    $ make geniso-isolinux
